# Wayfound

Enhances the exploration experience in Minecraft, via adding various QOL features whilst providing integrations with various other datapacks.

## Installation

You can simply install this as you would with any other datapack. This datapack also acts as a resource pack, as of now it is **not mandatory** to be installed as a resource pack but may be in future.

## Roadmap

This datapack has a lot of potential, and it would be great if it lives up to it!
Below are the enhancements we want to provide, in no particular order.

### Navigation

At the core of wayfound, we want to make exploration more immersive and engaging. Here is how we would do it:

- [x] Lodestone compasses are automatically renamed to the structure the Lodestone is within.
- [ ] Compasses display coordinates, clocks display the time, spyglasses show entity names/types.
- [ ] Journey Titles that are shown to players when they enter a structure, dimension or biome.
- [ ] Unique sounds that play when players enter certain types of structures.
- [ ] Let players view, set and unset their waypoints with a lodestone compass.
- [ ] Compass enchantments (makes player a waypoint, warps player on use, finds nearest entity).
- [ ] Provide a process for players to add the locations compasses point to on maps.

### Compatibility with other Datapacks

We are aiming to support various datapacks that expand Minecraft's world generation. Here's a list, with their corresponding links - feel free to check them out.

- [x] Support Dungeon's and Taverns.
- [x] Support Terralith.
- [ ] Support Hearths.
- [ ] Support Explorify.
- [ ] Support Incendium.
- [ ] Support Nullscape.
- [ ] Support Fathoms.

*If you want a datapack to be supported, let us know!*

### Lore & Myths

Why are we here? The canon lore of Minecraft is sea mysteries to be discovered, we want to  encourage theory crafting with our own take on the Minecraft canon. Here's some ideas we have:

- [ ] Randomised village/structure names.
- [ ] Random villager names, assigned on interaction.
- [ ] Provide players with a "Journal of journey", which records all structures their been too alongside some additional lore.
- [ ] Wandering traders exchange stories for emeralds.

### Quality of Life

Polish in the player experience is paramount. Here's what QOL we hope to have in store:

- [x] User friendly error reports so Wayfound developers can better fix your issues.
- [x] Provide APIs for other datapacks to support wayfound.
- [ ] Localisation for other languages besides english.
- [ ] Players can configure personal settings via a Dialog UI.
- [ ] Admins can configure global settings via a Dialog UI.
- [ ] Change compass textures.
